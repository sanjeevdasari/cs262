1. Is the service RESTful? If not, why not? If so, what key features make it RESTful.
    It is RESTful. It adheres the http protocol (for example they maps to CRUD correctly). Oother features are that it is stateless, provides data through JSON and shows a type of heirarchy.
2. What endpoints implement actions that are idempotent? nullipotent?
    GET, POST, and DELETE are idempotent because we can call them as multiple times as desired, and the result will not change depending on you calling it multiple times. Post is nullpotent, if it is called more than once on the object, there will be two identical copies of the object.
